You are working on a project with two source documents:

- `tasks.md`: Contains your implementation tasks.
- `spec.md`: Defines functional and behavioral requirements for the software you are implementing.

For each task:

1. Use `spec.md` to guide behavior, structure, and output.
2. Only implement whatâ€™s required for the current task.
3. Match any output formats, retry logic, or naming conventions specified.
4. Favor clarity and simplicity unless the spec demands complexity.
5. Ensure consistency across related tasks when needed.

After completing each task:

- Present a brief summary (what changed, where, and why).
- Propose a Git commit using conventional format (`feat:`, `fix:`, etc.)
- Wait for user approval before committing.
- Once approved, stage and commit the changes.
- Do not proceed to the next task until commit is approved.

If a task is unclear or not covered in `spec.md`, pause and ask.
