You are working on a project defined by:

- `tasks.md`: Lists implementation tasks
- `spec.md`: Defines required behavior, structure, and outputs

Follow this process:

1. For each task in `tasks.md` (under the TODO section):
   - Use `spec.md` to guide implementation.
   - Only implement what’s necessary for that task.
   - Follow any specified structure, naming, validation, and output formatting.
   - Maintain consistency across related tasks.

2. After completing a task:
   - **Move it to the DONE section at the top of `tasks.md`** (reverse chronological order).
   - Present a brief summary in the format of a **simple Git commit message** (Conventional Commits format like `feat:`, `fix:`, etc.)
   - Pause and wait for user review and approval.

3. The user will handle the actual Git commit.
   - Do not commit or proceed to the next task until explicitly approved.

4. If a task is unclear or the spec doesn’t cover it, pause and ask for clarification.
