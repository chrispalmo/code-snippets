Check python version (might need to use `python3` depending on how the system `PATH` variable is set up):
```
> py --version
Python 3.7.7
```

Create new project folder:
```
> mkdir my-new-project
> cd my-new-project
```
Create a vircual environment in the project root folder:
```
> py -m venv ./venv
```
Activate the virtual environment:
```
> ./venv/scripts/activate
```
Deactivate the virtual environment:
```
> deactivate
```
